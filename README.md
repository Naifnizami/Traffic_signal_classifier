# Traffic Signal Classification with Deep Learning

This project involves classifying traffic signs using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify traffic signals from a dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify traffic signs in images. The deep learning model is trained using the Traffic Sign Dataset, which contains various categories of traffic signs. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data augmentation and normalization to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
- **Model Architecture:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using Keras and TensorFlow.
- **Model Training:** The CNN model is trained on the Traffic Sign Dataset to learn patterns and features.
- **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics.
- **Model Saving:** After training, the model is saved in the `.h5` and `.keras` formats for easy use in deployment.
